            <h3>About Me</h2>
            <p><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Afx5ErDpCe7JXqnamNaL4ILxEAPY8ue0/preview" width="100" height="75" align="left"></iframe>From clinic to code: I am a nurse turned web developer. My journey began in Yaoundé, Cameroon, with a love for medicine and technology. I grew up in an area where access to resources, particularly computers, was scarce, but my love for technology often led me to spend my last dollar to pay for an Internet cafe. I was amazed the first time I used the internet, 
                I was intrigued and baffled by how so much information, and the ability to connect with so many distant friends and family was housed in the screen I was looking at. I wanted to know how does this thing really work? How can this world that is so big be made so accessible to me through a box with some fancy wires?

                Fast forward a decade or so: I moved to the United States, pursued my love for medicine by becoming a nurse, and once again, came face to face with my love for technology.
                
                At that point, I decided that a great first step is to become a full stack web developer, which is what I am now.</p>

                <h2>My Main Aim</h2>
                <p>My hope is to combine my background in medicine with my future in computer programming to do two things: create websites, applications and software that facilitate information processing and dissemination within the healthcare field, and to inspire others others to do the same.

                <h1>Mission</h1>
                <p>My mission is to spread technology worldwide, particularly in Africa where people are less fortunate and do not have access to computers, with the hope that my work will inspire the youth to want to teach others the skills they’ve learned from me.</p>

                <p>Web development not only teaches me how to code but it also teaches me to be creative in this ever changing technologically advanced world. This is why i have a people centered approach on my work.</p>
